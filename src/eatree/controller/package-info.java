/**
 * Package of the controller class for Eatree.
 * <p>
 * The controller handles the user input, modifies the model, and decides what the view should draw.
 * <p>
 * This package should contain the view and controller interfaces, since they are required to use the controller.
 * For example, there could be different view packages in the future, which all implement {@link eatree.controller.IEatreeView} and use
 * {@link eatree.controller.IEatreeController}
 *
 * This package also contain the game state enum. {@link eatree.controller.GameState}
